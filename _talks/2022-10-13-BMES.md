Cell-matrix junctions, in particular focal adhesions (FAs), regulate mechanobiological functions, e.g. proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Describing the multiscale linkage between substrate and FA mechanics is needed to reveal residue targets for mechanically activated diseases and to design engineered tissues that maintain desired cell health through mechanical cues. Here, we present a multiscale cell adhesion model, from the molecular mechanics of a cell-matrix junction to a 2D continuum model of a cell.
