I am a computational biophysicist interested in the interface between the cell and its surrounding environment, or matrix to improve health. Understanding the mechanics of the cell-matrix interface across nano and micro scales is instrumental for inspiring new therapeutics and biomaterials that limit cancer or expedite wound healing. During my PhD, I conceptualized and developed a multiscale computational model to propose a novel molecular mechanism in cell-matrix adhesion. Specifically, I used the finite element method and molecular dynamics simulations to present how the bonding dynamics between integrin and fibronectin progress under applied force. 

I am in the [Molecular Cell Biomechanics](https://biomechanics.berkeley.edu), advised by Prof. Mohammad Mofrad and the [Berkeley Biomechanics Lab](https://oconnell.berkeley.edu), advised by Prof. Grace O’Connell. I'm grateful to both of them for inspiring me to continue (and hopefully finish!) my Ph.D. My work is supported by the Robert N. Noyce Fellowship from the College of Engineering and the [Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship](https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/PGA_171962).

When I’m not wondering why my code is not working, you can find me venturing outside, lifting weights, or sleeping on the floor. Feel free to reach out! Ask me about grad school, skydiving, or the difference between biomechanics and mechanobiology.
