Just a mild-mannered Peruvian studying mechanobiology
======
I study the interplay between mechanics and the body across spatiotemporal scales. I use multiscale modeling to represent coupled physiological systems to move towards a holistic understanding of mechanobiology. Specifically, I use the finite element method and molecular dynamics to investigate the nanomechanics of adhesion molecules and how they couple to whole-cell mechanics.
