I study the interplay between mechanics and the body across spatiotemporal scales. Currently, I use multiscale modeling to represent coupled physiological systems to move towards a holistic understanding of mechanobiology. Specifically, I use the finite element method and molecular dynamics to investigate the nanomechanics of adhesion molecules and how they couple to whole-cell mechanics. I am in the [Molecular Cell Biomechanics](biomechanics.berkeley.edu), advised by Prof. Mohammad Mofrad and the [Berkeley Biomechanics Lab](oconnell.berkeley.edu), advised by Prof. Grace O'Connell, both from the Mechanical Engineering department and both of whom have inspired me to stick with grad school. My work is supported by the Robert N. Noyce Fellowship from the College of Engineering and the [Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship](https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/PGA_171962).

When I'm not wondering why my code is not working, you can find me venturing outside, lifting, or engaging in advocacy on campus as a [Diversity and Community Fellow](https://grad.berkeley.edu/graduate-diversity/contact-ogd/diversity-and-community-fellows/). If you see me around, ask me about grad school, skydiving, or sleeping on the floor.
