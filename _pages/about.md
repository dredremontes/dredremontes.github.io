I am a computational biophysicist, mechanobiologist, and engineer interested in exploring the interface between the cell and the extracellular matrix to improve health. Understanding the mechanics of the cell-matrix interface across nano and micro scales can inspire new therapeutics and biomaterials. I am an incoming Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the National Institutes of Health in the [MATRICES Lab](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/labs-at-nibib/section-mechanics-tissue-remodeling-integrating-computational-experimental-systems), advised by Dr. Manu Platt. During my PhD, I conceptualized and developed a multiscale computational model to propose a novel molecular mechanism in cell-matrix adhesion. Specifically, I used the finite element method and molecular dynamics simulations to represent how the bonding dynamics between integrin and fibronectin progress under applied force. I was a part of the [Molecular Cell Biomechanics](https://biomechanics.berkeley.edu), advised by Prof. Mohammad Mofrad and the [Berkeley Biomechanics Lab](https://oconnell.berkeley.edu), advised by Prof. Grace O’Connell. My work was supported by the [Hearts to Humanity Eternal Research Grant](https://h2h8.com), Robert N. Noyce Fellowship from the College of Engineering and the [Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship](https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/PGA_171962). I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Colorado School of Mines and hold 3.5 years of R&D experience in the medical device industry. When I’m not wondering why my code is not working, you can find me venturing outside, lifting weights, or sleeping on the floor. Feel free to reach out! Ask me about grad school, skydiving, or the difference between biomechanics and mechanobiology.
