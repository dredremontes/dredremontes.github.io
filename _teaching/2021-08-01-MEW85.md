This course introduces early undergraduates in mechanical and civil engineering to principles of solid mechanics. Topics include a review of equilibrium, truss structures, deformation, linear elasticity, bending, strain, stress, and buckling. I led two weekly discussion sections during the summer where I reviewed practice problems related to the weekly homework. I created two full practice midterms and a practice final. I recorded three exam review sessions to be shared with the class.
