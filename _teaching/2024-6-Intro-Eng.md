In this course, students gain exposure to one of the fastest growing fields today. From areas ranging from Mechanical Engineering to Biomedical Engineering, students are exposed to the growing number of disciplines within the field of engineering through guest lectures and group activities. The course also examines the professional ethics of engineering and evaluate accountability that engineers have to society and the environment. At the conclusion of this course, students will have an overall understanding of the engineering field, the different career paths available, and the ethics involved in the profession. For this course, I developed lesson plans, labs, and practice problem sets for two 3-week sessions. I introduced students to the exciting world of engineering through hands-on activities which included a force-sensing gripper, finite element simulations, and molecular dynamics.
