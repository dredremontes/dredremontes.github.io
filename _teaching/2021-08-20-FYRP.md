This course is designed to assist undergraduate and early graduate students identify their research interests by exposing them to research talks in the Mechanical Engineering department. I organized 20 graduate students within Mechanical Engineering to present their work to 20 undergraduates throughout the semester. I also led weekly research discussions and gave a 15-minute research presentation.
