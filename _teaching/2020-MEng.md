This course trains Masters of Engineering students to write persuasive reports, deliver captivating presentations, and engage diverse stakeholders. I led discussions and mentored a diverse group of graduate students in becoming top notch leaders. I collaborated with instructors to plan, organize, and deliver the course curriculum. I held weekly office hours and evaluated assignments.
